# Interaction Interview Test

In this repository you will find a design for a small piece of a larger project that needs to be built to be used on the web. There is a Photoshop CC file as well as a jpeg in the `artwork` directory that you can work from, along with all vector assets.

## Time

We are not looking for a super polished finish here and want to respect the time of user taking the test. With that being said we would encourage you to limit your time working on this to ~2 hours. Feel free to tackle the areas that will maximize productiviy, while skipping steps like code automation and testing.

## Boilerplate

There is an optional `server.js` file that can be run with `npm start` providing you with hosting static files in a `public` directory to save you time.

## Font

The font used in the Photoshop doc as well as the font desired for the end result is Open Sans (regular and bold) and can be found at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
